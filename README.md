# Acknowledgements
The development of FileIntegrity Sentinel was inspired by OAAmineâ€™s basic File Integrity Monitor (FIM). This project builds upon their initial work by adding new features and improvements, including:

Enhanced Error Handling: More robust handling of file-related errors and exceptions.
Flexible Directory Monitoring: Ability to monitor specified directories with an updated user interface.
Selective Monitoring: Options to start and stop monitoring as needed, and switch between different directories.
Improved Baseline Handling: More accurate baseline creation and comparison, with additional checks for file deletions and modifications.
